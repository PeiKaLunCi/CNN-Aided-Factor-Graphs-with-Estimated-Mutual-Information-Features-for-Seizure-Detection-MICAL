The number of layers for the proposed 1D CNN are selected same as 2D CNN architecture considered as the baseline model. We also designed the kernel size such that we could get the higher receptive field compared to the prior works. The details for kernel size and layer can be found in our previous paper at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02372.pdf
